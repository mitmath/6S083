    "In this problem set, we will develop our first proper model that exhibits an **epidemic\n",
    "outbreak**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will develop a **stochastic** (probabilistic) model of an infection propagating in a population  that is **well mixed**, i.e. in which everyone is in contact with everyone else.\n",
    "An example of this would be a small school or university in which people are\n",
    "constantly moving around and interacting with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, we will make modelling assumptions that allow us to reach the goal as fast and simply as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is an **individual-based** or **agent-based** model -- in other words,\n",
    "we explicitly keep track of each individual in the population and what their\n",
    "infection status is. However, we will not keep track of their position in space;\n",
    "we will just assume that there is some mechanism by which they interact with\n",
    "other individuals which we do not include in the model (for now)."

    "## Exercise 1: Modelling the spread of an infection or rumour\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will model the spread of an infection or rumour in which\n",
    "there is no recovery via a stochastic model, which we will implement in a Monte Carlo\n",
    "simulation (i.e. a simulation that involves generating random numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call the individuals **agents**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Julia has a data type called an [**enumerated type**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type). Variables of this type can only take one of a pre-defined set of values; we will use this to model the possible internal state of an agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code to define an enum is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```julia\n",
    "    @enum InfectionStatus S I R\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This defines a new type `InfectionStatus`, as well as names `S`, `I` and `R` that are the only possible values that a variable of this type can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define a variable `x` equal to `S`. What is its type?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Convert `x` to an integer using the `Int` function. What value does it have? What values do `I` and `R` have?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Take $N=100$. Make an array `agents` whose $i$th entry is the status of agent\n",
    "number $i$. Make them all initially susceptible.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now choose a single agent at random and make it infectious. (Hint: Use the\n",
    "    `rand` function with a range to choose the index of the infectious agent.)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write a function `step!` that takes a `Vector` `agents` and a probability `p_I`\n",
    "as arguments.  This function may *modify* the content of `agents` to implement one step of the infection dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Choose an agent $i$ at random.\n",
    "    2. If $i$ is not infectious then nothing happens on this step so you can just `return`\n",
    " from the function.\n",
    "     3. Choose another agent $j$ at random. Make sure that $i \\neq j$. To do so, repeat this\n",
    "    choice *until* $i \\neq j$.\n",
    "    4. If $j$ is not infected then $i$ infects $j$ with probability $p_I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Write a function `sweep!`. It runs `step!` $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of agents. Thus each agent acts, on average, once per sweep. One sweep is thus the unit\n",
    "of time in our Monte Carlo simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Write a function `infection_simulation`. It should take $N$ and $p_I$ as arguments,\n",
    "as well as $T$, the total number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. First generate the `Vector` `agents` of length $N$ and a `Vector` `Is` to store\n",
    "    the number of infectious individuals at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Run `sweep!` a number $T$ of times. Calculate the total number of infectious\n",
    "    agents at the end of each step and store that number in `Is`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Return `Is` as the output of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Run your simulation 50 times with $N=100$ and collect the data in a `Vector` of `Vector`s called `results`, using $p_I = 0.02$ and $T = 1000$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Plot each of the 50 graphs on the same plot using transparency 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Calculate the mean trajectory using the `mean` function applied to `results`. [This \"just works\" since `mean` is implmented in a generic way!] Add it to the plot using a heavier line.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Calculate the standard deviation $\\sigma$ of $I$ at each step. [This should thus be a *vector.] Add this to the plot using **error bars**, using the option `yerr=σ` in the plot command; use transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This should confirm that the distribution of $I$ at each step is pretty wide!\n",
    "\n",
    "9. You should see that the mean behaves in a similar way to what we saw in lectures using a *deterministic* model. So what is the deterministic model possibly describing, in terms of the stochastic model?"

    "## Exercise 2: Agent type\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to track more information about each agent, e.g. how many other agents were infected by that agent. We could just create an additional array with that information in, but we will need to pass that around and will start to lose track of what belongs together.\n",

    "    end\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Make an array `agents` of `Agent`s. Set the first one's infection status to `I`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Rewrite your code from Exercise 1 to use the new `Agent` type. Now when your functions accept an `agents`\n",
    "vector, they should assume that that represents a `Vector` of `Agent` objects.\n",

    "    You can enforce this using a function signature like\n",

    "5. Update an agent's `num_infected` field whenever it infects another agent.\n",

    "6. At the end of the simulation, extract the probability distribution of the \"number of agents infected\", using your code from Exercise 1 of Problem Set 2.\n",
    "\n",

You should see graphs that look familiar from the internet, with an epidemic outbreak, i.e. a significant fraction of infectious agents after a short time, which then recover.\n",
